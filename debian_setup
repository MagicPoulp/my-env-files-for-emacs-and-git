--> the XFCE desktop is much better because gnome is heavy with sounds and it uninstalls stuff when pinnin packagesx

--> for double boot Debian/Windows
1 deactivate secure boot in the bios
2 -->> shrink the Windows partition on windows to make a partition of more than 300 GB, like 303 GB, to have exactly 300 GB in debian installer
3 -->> install debian on exactly 300 GB

4. set up double boot
One must use F12 at the startup.

It may be that the order cannot be change. To live with it, we force the windows startup to crash.
The Windows boot manager gets an error and then win OK one can pick windows, but only by choice

use bcdedit on windows to block the windows startup by setting ubuntu at the top
The boot order wont change but it will prevent windows from starting a long startup sequence.

bcdedit /enum firmware
bcdedit /default [[ubuntu id]]
bcdedit /setdisplay {fwbootmgr} {default} /addfirst
Don't break the computer by too many tries

--> to fix the dmesg error:
firmware: failed to load rtl_nic/rtl8168g-2.fw
find the debian package
firmware-realtek_0.43_all.deb

--> automatic login (not at work)
sudo emacs /etc/gdm3/daemon.conf

--> get the .myvars, .emacs, and git script from my github, MagicPoulp

--> set up the pinning of packages from debian testing and unstable
PINNING is dangerous! one can make the distribution unstable or remove vital packages
We only want to update if asked, so we use negative priorities

1.
apt-get clean
apt-get autoclean
nano /etc/apt/apt.conf
APT::Cache-Limit "100000000";

2. add an append.list in the sources.list.d

deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian testing main non-free contrib

# Testing security updates repository
deb http://security.debian.org/ testing/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ testing/updates main contrib non-free


# Unstable repo main, contrib and non-free branches, no security updates here
deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian unstable main non-free contrib
deb-src http://http.us.debian.org/debian unstable main non-free contrib

3. set up the pinning not taking aall from unstable
