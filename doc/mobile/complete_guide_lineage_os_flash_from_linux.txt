This picture provides a proof of a successful installation of LineageOS.

[![image lost when editing][1]][1]

This guide explains how to install LineageOS (open source Android) 21 (based on Android 14) on Samsung Galaxy S10 from Debian or Ubuntu Linux.

The question of this thread was asking on MacOS Linux not Debian Linux. On macOS you will have to find a way to install adb, fastboot, and heimdall by searching on the internet. adb is installed easily with Android Studio or with a standalone download. For heimdall and fastboot, there are many answers on the internet. You should use fastboot and avoid heimdall for flashing all the .img. Fastboot cannot be used for everything. You need heimdall for the recovery.img that needs heimdall once to create a fastboot mode on the device, this mode is shipped with the lineageOS recovery.img. And the program I used on Debian is called fastboot, not fastbootd, so without an ending D.

This guide can work for other phone models. The combination of buttons to start fastboot mode or download mode may change.

The model I have does not have a fastboot mode at all but it has a download mode and a recovery mode from Samsung.
The download mode allows to flash a recovery from Lineage os that can run a fastboot mode and do other things like install non official binaries using adb sideload

Note on nice Lineage features:

- Lineage allows to have security updates on devices that Samsung stopped to support for security updates.  
- Lineage allows to have a newer Android version.  
- Lineage is secure due to its open source nature (Like Linux kernel, or Debian). A few security companies support it.  
- LineageOS 21 (Android 14) when it starts, it allows to copy all settings from another Android using Bluetooth using a QR code that one phone takes with the camera (we do not have this at startup on the original Android 12 after a factory reset).    
- LineageOS allows to install old Androids for testing purpose.  

### 1. Preparation and set OEM unlock

- Back up all data so you do not risk losing data.
- Enable debug mode in Android settings pressing 7 times build version
- In developer mode set USB mode and set OEM unlock, that is the thing that protects flashing another Android.

Bootloader unlock and OEM unlock are 2 different things. And following the next steps of this guide, you will need 3 steps. OEM unlock in settings, bootloader unlock in the download mode screen, and then a trick to make OEM be grayed out in settings and really triggered.

Remember that pressing all buttons will shut down the phone if you are stuck

After later reboots, you will see OEM enable. And if something does not work later, go back to this step and check it.

Install adb heimdall-flash and fastboot
note: adb could be used from Android Studio

`adb` is to run commands on the device and to push files and to reboot in download mode
heimdall is to flash the recovery.img
fastboot is to flash all remaining .img after booting in recovery

```none
sudo apt update && sudo apt install default-jdk
sudo apt install android-tools-adb && sudo apt install android-tools-fastboot
sudo apt install heimdall-flash
```

### 1.bis Adjustment if LineageOS is already installed

The Trust app has a system to disactivate USB conncetio,. it must be set to always active. USB debugging must be active, and default USB configuration must be on file transfer.

On a phone already with LineageOS, to move from Lineage 21 to Lineage22, I had a strange bug with "adb device" not detecting the device. After having tried 2 different phones, and 2 different computers, I suspected my cable, and it was causing the problem. And the "adb devices" worked with a new cable when in recovery mode, after clicking enable ADB in the recovery mode. It allowed me to run "adb reboot download" to flash with heimdall. However, in download mode, adb devices reported empty, but that was not blocking and the flashing of heimdall worked. Then I proceeded according to the guide, went in fastboot mode, and I could flash everything, then I could flash LINE.zip and MIND.zip in sideload using adb that worked with "adb device".

1. Download all the files for lineagesOS from the website, and pick the right device. All files are important.
1. Pick the latest Lineage version you can find.
1. Download gapps of the right android version. it is for goole mail apps, etc and recommended by guides.

**Note**: as a commenter said, the Android SDK is not mandatory. I used adb from the Android SDK because I had it already. But you can have adb via the apt install command above.

### 2. Enter Download mode

Before entering Download mode, you must have activated OEM unlock in the developer settings in the Android settings. And in 3.bis, this same setting will be made disabled all grayed out to go further.

Download mode is a mode that allows using heimdall, a flash program for Linux

It depends on devices,

volume down + bixby + plug in USB cable that is connected to the computer, enter download mode

Another way to enter download mode is via adb reboot download when the device is in USB debug mode (an option in developer settings, and developer settings is enabled by pressing 7 times the build number in software information in the settings on Android).

### 3. Unlock bootloader

In download mode pressing volume up for a long time will unlock the bootloader, to allow installing and flashing. It documents one the screens what you can do. If nothing is said concerning activating OEM unlock, you must activate the option in Android settings, in developer mode. Developer mode is activated by pressing 7 times the build number in software information.

### 3. bis ensure OEM unlock is grayed out in the settings

Before you move to step 4, you must ensure that OEM unlock is present and grayed out in the Developer settings in a Android.
If it is not, you will not be able to flash any custom binary.
There is a combination of tricks to ensure that it is that way.

It was found on [a tutorial](https://www.thecustomdroid.com/fix-missing-oem-unlock-toggle-samsung-galaxy-devices/#how_to_fix_missing_oem_unlock_toggle_on_samsung_galaxy_devices) that I give for curiosity, but I will sum it up.

1. Go in Android and put the time to a date older that 8 days ago.  
2. Remove auto time update.  
3. Search in settings there are several places with automatic updates, even security updates (one is cauled auto update system in developer options).  
4. Reboot Android.  
5. Now go in the Settings and find the reset, to factory reset Android.  

The phone will restart, and like all new you must pick the language, etc. You do not need to enter your Google Account. Do the minimum setup since you will override it later by LineageOS, but it is important that you connect to a working WiFi, with the WiFi password. And you must perform the update.

After the phone starts, go in the settings and enable the developer options (it shows up with tap 7 times on the row Build number in Sofwware information). And in the Developer options, check that OEM unlock is grayed out in the list. If it is you have succeeded.
Enable the USB debugging in the Developer settings.

### 4. Use the adb command to start in a better version of download mode with less text

    ~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb devices

if adb devices does not look good, you need to unplug the USB-C cable and plug it again, to trigger a reconnection. It is important that USB debugging is activated in the Developer options

    ~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb reboot download

There are two different download mode: the adb way and the bixby + volume down and plug in power cable. It is recommended to use the adb reboot download to flash heimdall.

**For later**: To enter Recovery mode, you must be in download mode, trigger a restart with volume down + bixy + power, and when it restarts, push very fast volume up + bixby + power for a long time (20s) and it enters the recovery mode (more details at step 5 below). Lineageos has a recovery you can flash using debian at step 4 below. heimdall can be installed on Debian. It is heimdall that can flash the recovery. Be sure to have OEM unlock in debug options of android, then in download mode boot, unlock bootloader.
Then if your reboot enough and wipe data then heimdall will have no error and can flash.

--> Use "adb reboot download" to enter a good mode for the download mode so you can flash with heimdall.

If the command below results with a red line of error (only official binaries...) on the phone's screen, you miss the step 3. bis above.

Now we erase the Samsung default recovery, and we put the LineageOS one. heimdall is just needed in download mode for doing this. Later, all flashing of other files will be down in fastboot mode with the fastboot command.

    heimdall flash --RECOVERY recovery.img --no-reboot

The `--no-reboot` is important so you have time to leave the download mode and immediately press the right buttons for the recovery mode.
If you are not fast enough, it will erase what you have just flashed when rebooting. This trick was found on link 2 at the end.

For me, heimdall had an error "ERROR: Failed to receive session end confirmation!"
and on the phone screen it said only official binaries are allowed.
So I missed the step 3.bis above.
Then I could make it work without error.

For this kind of error, it is important to reboot in download mode using adb
adb reboot download, and this may need to be down after a standard android startup.

So I erased data in the Samsung recovery mode, and I check OEM unlock is well set.
It is important you do not skip the bootloader unlock above.

### 5. trick to enter recovery mode

At this step you are in download mode and just flashed with heimdall a recovery.img from lineage
press volume down + bixby
it will leave the download mode and reboot
as soon as the screen change, press very fast volume up + bixby + power, and keep pressing for 20 seconds until the phone enters recovery mode

If you fail, you cant press all button to shutdown everything. Put the phone in rest. and later enter again the download mode using one of 2 ways (adb from a started Android, or volume down + bixby and then insert power cable when phone is shutdown).

Recovery mode is much easier to enter by holding pressed very fast the right buttons when leaving download mode using 2 buttons. You cannot just start the phone and enter recovery mode that easily.

### 6. In recovery mode if you have reached it, it will say recovery at the top in a very special screen

you will have the lineage logo on top if you have the good recovery mode.

If it says Samsung at the top, then you had an error in the heimdall command and need to go back to step 3.bis and check the bootloader is unlocked.

**Important**: you can navigate inside  recovery mode using volume up and down to move the cursor, and power button to select an option.

If ever you need adb, note that the recovery mode has an option to enable adb, but you should not enable it if you do not need it since it can affect the sideload installation mode which is another adb mode

- Wipe all data, it is safe.  
- Then enter fastboot in the menu.  
- It takes a long time to boot it.
  
Then use the fastboot command from Debian to flash all files (you may have more files downloaded from LineageOS's website)

```none
fastboot flash boot boot.img  
fastboot flash dtbo dtbo.img  
fastboot flash dtb dtb.img  
fastboot flash super_empty super_empty.img  
fastboot flash vbmeta vbmeta.img  
```

The super_empty may fail, but it is not important.

And flashing the recovery is optional it you already have it from the heimdall command. But I like to make a fresh one with newer files.

now reboot in recovery mode

### 6.bis Optional. Install vendor.img from the stock OEM official from Samsung. This is very optional so you may move directly to point 7. But is is recommended to do it for security, stability and performance.

Update the so-called blobs. update the official Samsung proprietary, closed-source drivers and firmware that LineageOS works with. There is still some proprietary stuff that LineageOS needs.

If you do not do this, you will see out of date for vendor patches in lineageOS Settings -> in Security / Privacy -> in More security and privacy -> in Trust. Even if Samsung stopped releasing, it is good to have updated ones.

To do this part, you need to install the Stock ROM from Samsung to get the newest drivers and firmware. Then you will need to install LineageOS again. To download the Stock ROM, you may use Bifrost (https://github.com/zacharee/SamloaderKotlin), or if you wnat something more official you can use Samsung Smart Switch.

In the block below is explained in detail how to download the stock OEM from Samsung and install the vendor.img

In the block after this one it is explained how to flash all the critical parts, and also why certain parts can be avoided.

```none
from a debian host

sudo mkdir -p  /srv/chroot/debian
sudo  debootstrap trixie /srv/chroot/debian http://deb.debian.org/debian
cd /srv/chroot/debian
mount -t proc /proc proc

   26  apt update
   27  apt install libglib2.0-bin
   28  apt install libgtk-3-0
   29  apt install default-jre
   30  bifrost

---

in the settings about phone you may find your exact device model
then you will be able to download the stock OEM in the form of a ZIP.
we will just install the vendor.img in it. But a similar procedure can be used for all parts

---------

recovery mode and heimdall is required, you must not install vendor.img in fastboot. This is due to the dual partition system and the overriding.

Reason (from Gemini):
"Heimdall is an open-source tool that implements the proprietary flashing protocol used by Samsung's official flashing software, Odin.

This protocol operates when the device is in Download Mode.

Crucially, this low-level mode and its protocol are the only interfaces Samsung's hardware and bootloader expose for accessing and writing to certain critical partitions, including vendor, bootloader, modem, and in many cases, even the initial recovery partition.

The bootloader itself controls the permissions and methods for writing to internal storage partitions. Samsung's bootloaders are programmed to accept commands for these low-level partitions only through their specific protocol (Heimdall/Odin) in Download Mode."

---------
rename the AP....tar.md5 in the zip file, tar -xf the file
sudo apt install lz4
lz4 -d vendor.img.lz4 allow to get vendor.img
To flash using heimdall the vendor.img:
enter the special download mode, then enter recovery mode, then enable adb in recovery mode, and the do adb reboot download on the debian linux.
once in download mode run this
sudo heimdall flash --VENDOR vendor.img --no-reboot
IMPORTANT. when using power down and power to restartm immediately put the fingers for the recovery mode, or the flashing will be overriden.
If you could enter recovery mode you succeeded. And the flashing of vendor.img worked

It is normal that in settings of lineage os in security and privacy and more security options and in trust it wil lsay vendor out of date, because samesung stopped doing updates, and the one we flashed is old from 2023 but it is the latest.

It is normal to have a build version mismatch between the vendor.img locally and the one from adb, as shown below. It seems that LineageOS forces this data to appear,but the vendor.img is still the good one.

version from vendor.img after using simg2img (installable in debian bullseye in a chroot)
sudo grep 'ro.vendor.build.version.incremental' vendor_mount/build.prop
ro.vendor.build.version.incremental=G973FXXSGHWC1

version from adb on the device:
adb shell getprop | grep 'vendor.build.version.incremental'
[ro.vendor.build.version.incremental]: [dbc0a2f32a]

```


Below is how to install Vendor, Bootloader full parts, and Modem connectivity parts.

```none
From Bifrost, I could download a zip that contains for my model 4 tar archive files:

HOME_CSC_...	Region/Settings (NO-WIPE)	This file contains the same configuration data but is designed to be flashed while preserving user data. However, for a clean LineageOS installation, this file is generally avoided, as a clean wipe using the standard CSC file is preferred for maximum stability.


Gemini explains the files: "The most important files to flash are the Bootloader (BL) and the Modem (CP), as they contain proprietary code that LineageOS cannot update itself.
File	Component	Why it's Important for LineageOS
BL_...	Bootloader	Security & Stability: Contains the core code that initializes your hardware. Newer versions often include critical security patches (e.g., against low-level exploits) and stability fixes for the hardware.
CP_...	Modem/Radio	Efficiency & Functionality: Handles all cellular communication (calls, texts, mobile data, GPS). Flashing the latest version ensures optimal signal reception, better battery efficiency in cellular usage, and compatibility with modern network standards.
AP_...	System/Vendor	Compatibility: Contains the proprietary vendor.img and dtb files (Device Tree Blob). LineageOS needs the correct, matching vendor files to access all your phone's hardware (camera, fingerprint sensor, display, etc.). You already extracted and flashed the vendor partition from here.

Other Files

File	Component	Role in LineageOS Installation
CSC_...	Region/Settings	Optional Clean Slate: Flashing the CSC file (not HOME_CSC) performs a factory reset and ensures all partitions are completely cleaned and reset to their default state before you install LineageOS, which can sometimes prevent unexpected issues.
HOME_CSC_...	Region/Settings (NO-WIPE)	This file contains the same configuration data but is designed to be flashed while preserving user data. However, for a clean LineageOS installation, this file is generally avoided, as a clean wipe using the standard CSC file is preferred for maximum stability."

IMPORTANT ---> I decided to flash the vendor.img from AP, and the full content of the BL and CP.
vendor and BL are for security and stability. And CP is for the network and modem to work well and be updated and secure.

IMPORTANT --> I made sure the download mode never reboots the normal boot so I can manually restart to recovery mode and avoid an override (important for vendor.img and recovery.img), amd then I reinstalled full LineageOS after.

to make heimdall work one must often redo the "adb reboot download" when in recovery mode with enable adb click
the download mode loses connectivity over time so an adb reboot download refreshes it

Then reboot and all is fine
```

### 7. Install programs

now reboot in recovery mode (see the step 3.bis above)

be sure the gapps has the corresponding android version number.
rename the lineageos zip in LINE.zip
and rename the gapps.zip in MIND.zip
it prevents bugs to have shorter paths it is recommended by all guides

TWRP, another recovery image, uses adb push to `/sdcard`, but TWRP does not work on Android 10+
With the recovery image from lineageOS, we use adb sideload

You need to select in the recovery mode menu:

Apply update
then go to adb Sideload and in sub-menus
you must go deep so that the sideload is activated
when you run adb devices it should say sideload.
adb devices can say unauthorized, recovery (if you do enable adb in the menu), or sideload

Now run sideload on the linage zip
do not check to reboot

    ~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb sideload LINE.zip

You need to navigate the menu and pick deep in the menu apply update to
 be able to have sideload access with adb. And you may need to move in the menu and pick yes.

Before installing Gapps, know that it is required to have the Play store available.

Then install gapps

    ~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb sideload MIND.zip

Note that the sideload of MIND will open a menu Yes/No to continue anyway despite authenticity is not guaranteeed. Press Yes. It is safe since we used the LineageOS website to get the file.

If after reboot, gmail is not available, then it may be normal since gogole changes stuff and so apps are note provided any more. Then you will to be able install Gmail app from the Play Store by searching gmail in it.

Then reboot.
And you will have to leave OEM unlocked and bootloader unlocked forever. If you disable it from the download mode, it will block the restart in a loop and it will be difficult (but possible) to shutdown and then to set it back from the step above (long press on volume button)

The first time it may ask to wipe data and to reboot.
Leave it time with the rotating logo.

Then Lineage starts well.
Be sure to check the right options and not go too fast,
like the checkbox auto updating the recovery image when updating.

FINISHED.

the information below is just for extra help and information.

In the Trust settings (searching Android security patches), it says vendor patch is NOT up to date. It refers to the firmware from Samsung. There is a firmware provided by LineageOS for my device. But I decided NOT to flash the firmware. Because during 5 years owning the device, Samsung never made me update that firmware. And I am not 100% trusting for that LineageOS firmware. But I use my phone with low risk, not paying with it, etc.

---

Setup LineageOS to make it user friendly

I recommend moving one level up the text size just after the LineageOS installation is done and starts. it is on level 2, and I put in on 3.

To copy data from another device, you may need to pair manually the device in the Bluetooth menu (slide from top bar), and do it on both devices
On the source phone, open google app (installable in google play)
And type set up my device in the search bar.
To perform this operation from the destination device, you need to wait for a notification that says last step to set up device (slide top bar to see it in blue notification).

You can install missing things like Google Photos from the Play Store.

During the initial configuration, The fingerprint sensor may take 15 seconds to appear, just be patient on the black screen.

I use English as a system language. For the keyboard, I use a French (querty) with autocorrection that give suggestions of words for the accents. Android keyboard (AOSP) has 2 entries in the settings, one called manage allows you to pick a language. There can be multiple already set up. If you pick just one, like French (Querty), it will be the only language for the keyboard, and also it applies to the spelling correction.

-----------------------------------------------

useful adb commands:
If ever you need adb, note that the recovery mode has an option to enable adb

    ~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb devices
    ~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb shell uname -m               (to know the Android version)
    ~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb devices
    ~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb reboot download

one can see all the partitions using this print command, but in download mode only
heimdall print-pit --no-reboot

one can set a device in root using "magisk" but it is not recommended to have root

### 8. Important remark if SMS do not work

I had an SMS problem that I fixed.

With the standard LineageOS Messaging app, I could receive but not send SMS, on multiple phones, on 2 different telecom operators.

With gapps in section 7, it does not install all possible google applications. And I had a LineageOS messaging app, instead of Google Messages. But with Gapps, I could access Google Play, and through it I could search and find Google Messages. Be sure to have the official one.

Inside Google Messages, I could configure in settings to deactivate Chats RCS. It was the advice that the technical support from my operator told me. This change of Chats RCS totally fixed my problem. Of course I also had to make Google Messages as my standard. According to support, it is linked to the temporary telephone number for the new operator. And he told me the old number is stuck and putting chats RCS off and waiting 10days would purge this old number, and then I should put chats RCS back activated, if it does not work for SMS he asked me to request a new free SIM card.

If the SMS do not work, check also MMS access point names in connection with your telecom operator. But in my case it was automatically configured correctly. MMS are advanced SMS with images and sounds.
