there is a details page once one starts a VM

there is the virtio driver iso from fedora that improves the graphics

a raw file is better, then pick it in the installer using virt-manager
qemu-img create -f raw win10.img 150G

install the spice-guest-tools, and then put the video on QXL, and reboot, and then this command line can ssh to windows:
remote-viewer spice://localhost:5900
