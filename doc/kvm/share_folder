And this is how to mount
sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.122.125/Users/ThierryVilmart/Desktop/repos /media/vm -o user=externo,password=asd,uid=1000,gid=1000,mfsymlinks

or add this in /etc/fstab
//192.168.122.125/Users/ThierryVilmart/Desktop/repos /media/vm cifs user=externo,password=asd,uid=1000,gid=1000,mfsymlinks
And then one can mount using
sudo mount /media/vm

it is important to replace teh gid and uid with the ones of the linux machine, using id -g thierry and id -u thierry
the ui adn gid are so taht not only root has access but also the user

the option mfsymlinks enables symlinks to work
