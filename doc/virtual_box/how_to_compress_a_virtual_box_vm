We are talking about compressing a deployed and runnable VM in the Users folder, we are not talking about not an export (.ova)
We will fille zÃ©ros on unused space and then rune a viurtualbox command that reduces teh disk size

create a root user
sudo passwd root

We follow that tutiral for the rest

-----------------------

-- install zerofree

sudo apt install zerofree

-- reboot into ubuntu recovery console, hold down [RIGHT SHIFT]
sudo reboot

in the grub menu start in recovery mode
advanced options -> recovery mode -> root console
put root passworf to enter the console

-- find the root directory

mount |grep "sda"

no space before grep

-- run zerofree

after the echo "u" below the shell will become hard to use due to message but it can be used
the echo u command helps to mount in read only

echo "u" > /proc/sysrq-trigger
mount /dev/mapper / -o remount,ro
zerofree -v /dev/sda1
reboot

shutdown -r now

-- compress the drive

cd to the VM that contains the disk
C:\Users\SESA780079\VirtualBox VMs\linux-dev-v2 1>
"C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" modifyhd linux-dev-v2-disk001.vdi --compact
