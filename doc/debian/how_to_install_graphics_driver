Add jessie-backports to your /etc/apt/sources.list, for example:
using the nano editor

# jessie-backports
deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-free

Install Linux headers for the kernel you are using. If you are using the 3.16 Linux kernel in Debian Jessie:

# apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,')

Or if you are already using a Linux kernel from jessie-backports:

# apt-get install -t jessie-backports linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,')

Then we can install the package nvidia-driver.

# apt-get update
# apt-get install -t jessie-backports nvidia-driver

DKMS will build the nvidia module for your system.
Restart your system to enable the nouveau blacklist.

restart from the OS menu, not on command line or it gets stuck
