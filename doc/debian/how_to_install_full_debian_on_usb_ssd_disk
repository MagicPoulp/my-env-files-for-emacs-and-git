sumarry:
the debian advanced installer will only create a gpt table if you put zeros on teh disk first and only with dd
then dont install grub from the installer, start in the installer rescue mode, grub-install --removable, then update-grub
install the buster-backports kernel before running update-grub
apt update && apt-get install linux-image-amd64 -t buster-backports
and pick http as mirror
sudo fdisk -l
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=512 count=1


One should not use flash memory because the write cycles are limited and will wear out
The advanced debian installer must be used to be sure GPT partitioning is used or it adds an extended partition if MBR is used

After the installation, reinstall grub so that it finds the stuff that by standard is put on the flash of the motherboard
One must reinstall grub using a chroot on the mounted usb from another computer, or in rescue mode iin the debian installer

sudo mnt /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
cd /mnt/usb
sudo mount -t proc proc proc/
sudo mount --rbind /sys sys/
sudo mount --rbind /dev dev/
sudo chroot /mnt/usb /bin/bash
grub-install --removable --uefi-secure-boot
update-grub

note:
grub-install --force-extra-removable is not good, it is to support buggy firmwarses in a normal install
see the source apt-get source grub2-common

--uefi-secure-boot     install an image usable with UEFI Secure Boot.
one must install grub-efi-amd64-signed
and the produced removable image is totally different

optional and dangerous: it may be good to copy grubx64.efi into BOOTX64.efi if bootx64 cannot boot

check that /etc/fstab is matching the following and if not edit fstab with nano
ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid

optional:
remove non-grub things in /EFI/boot/
so that the bios auto detects the right one.

See the last line at the second link
first mount the efi partition, and create the directories
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB
https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/html_node/Installing-GRUB-using-grub_002dinstall.html

do not use gnome it looks too strange
xfce4 is nice

it may be good to install firmwares, which are fully portable.
add contrib non-free in the apt sources.list
firmware-atheros
firmware-linux-nonfree
firmware-realtek

It is better to isntall in advanced mode and allow non-free, and one must find the tar file with the list of all firmwares one can intall.

install linux-image-amd64 from buster-backports
It fixes problems booting on USB3.

When all works fine, run the following to check the USB speed
lsusb
lsusb -t

10000M means USB 3.1
5000M means USB 3.0
400M means USB 2.0

If the screen is slightly flickering,
it maye be good to install graphics drivers, but it will reduce stability and require reinstallation after every kernel update
Note: graphics drivers are not portable accross computers
linux-headers-amd64 nvidia-driver nvidia-kernel-dkms
