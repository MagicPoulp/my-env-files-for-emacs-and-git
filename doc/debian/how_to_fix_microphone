arrows may be needed in alsamixer to see the rear mic and not jsut the front mic

solution:
connect microphone before booting
sudo rm -r ~/.config/pulse /tmp/pulse-*
pulseaudio --kill
pulseaudio --start
sudo alsamixer
unmute and add volume to the rear mic

then this command here works:
arecord -f S24_LE -c 2 -r 192000 -d 3 /tmp/test-mic.wa
And I get the recorded sound with aplay.

However, the sound is of extremely bad quality with lots of noise.
But this is another problem.

Update:
WIth the mic volume to 75, and the boost to 55, the sound quality becomes quite good. Especially good since my computer's ventilator is loud and I do not hear it at all.
