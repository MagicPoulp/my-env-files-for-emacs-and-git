IMPORTANT:
if the device is on /dev/sdb1, one must write of=/dev/sdb, without the terminating 1
I saw myself that this small difference makes the disk bootable

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> get the iso image from the Debian official website:

there is the live images
there is the install image, really designed for EFI but it works also on legacy boots
one can even format the entire disk, create a 3rd partition for the EFI, and then activate the BIOS to boot on that EFI partition as a new boot option

--> to create the bootable usb:

the different accessible file systems can be listed by using
sudo fdisk -l
usually sda is for the hard disk and is dangerous to use
sdb1 or sdc1 should be for the USB stick

The usb stick can be formated with gparted

from the Debian doc:
https://www.debian.org/CD/faq/
dd if=<file> of=<device> bs=4M; sync

IMPORTANT:
if the device is on /dev/sdb1, one must write of=/dev/sdb, without the terminating 1

example:
dd if=pathToDebian.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M; sync

--> to install Debian

1. shrink the partition on Windows

2. install from the usb stick, after deactivating secure boot and fast boot in the BIOS, and optionaly after activating legacy boot (but all in EFI boot is better)
choose the graphic install
create a logical partition as swap
create a primary partition as ext4 mounted on /
