--> I must not shutdown my computer with a non-ejected USB stick. Rebooting can corrupt the USB stick.

I must eject the USB stick in a good way as documented below.
It is important because sometimes I have a read only corrupted USB stick that I must reformat with gparted

--> to list available devices:

sudo fdisk -l

--> to mount a FAT42 stick:

in FAT there is no user mode, so atrick is needed to mount for non root users

sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/thierry/KINGSTON -o rw,umask=0000

--> to mount an ext4 stick:

sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/thierry/KINGSTON -o rw

--> to eject:

close all shells using the USB stick

unmount:
sudo umount /media/thierry/KINGSTON

eject:
sudo eject /dev/sdb1

see StackOverfloow thread that recommends to usee eject

--> gparted
gparted can format an USB disk if all its data is saved somewhere else
a special device must be selected in the menu of gparted to see USB devices
