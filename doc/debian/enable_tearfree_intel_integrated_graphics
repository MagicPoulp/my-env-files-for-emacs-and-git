man intel
Option "TearFree" "boolean"
              Disable  or  enable TearFree updates. This option forces X to perform all rendering to a backbuffer prior to updating the actual
              display. It requires an extra memory allocation the same size as a framebuffer, the occasional extra copy, and  requires  Damage
              tracking. Thus enabling TearFree requires more memory and is slower (reduced throughput) and introduces a small amount of output
              latency, but it should not impact input latency. However, the update to the screen is then performed synchronously with the ver‐
              tical  refresh  of  the  display  so that the entire update is completed before the display starts its refresh. That is only one
              frame is ever visible, preventing an unsightly tear between two visible and differing frames. Note that this replicates what the
              compositing  manager  should be doing, however TearFree will redirect the compositor updates (and those of fullscreen games) di‐
              rectly on to the scanout thus incurring no additional overhead in the composited case. Also note that not all  compositing  man‐
              agers prevent tearing, and if the outputs are rotated, there will still be tearing without TearFree enabled.

              Default: TearFree is disabled.
