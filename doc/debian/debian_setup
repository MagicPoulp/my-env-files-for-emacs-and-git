the Debian USB key needs to be created as EFI only. Note that Debian live does not have EFI, only Debian install has it.

--> the XFCE desktop is much better because gnome is heavy with sounds and it uninstalls stuff when pinnin packagesx

--> for double boot Debian/Windows
1 deactivate secure boot in the bios
deactivate fast startup in power options of windows, or we can break the OS
2 -->> shrink the Windows partition on windows to make a partition of more than 300 GB, like 303 GB, to have exactly 300 GB in debian installer
better to use gparted on a live usb for EFI booting
3 -->> install debian

--> Note that after installing Debian, the screen will be black.
To boot, in grub, type e, then add "nomodeset" before quiet

--> automatic login (not at work)
it depends on which desktop is used

for gnome:
sudo emacs /etc/gdm3/daemon.conf
add:
AutomaticLoginEnable = true
AutomaticLogin = thierry
then run:
sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm3

--> change grub default timeout to 2 s
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
update-grub

--> start he console in full screen
change the icon preferences:
exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator xfce4-terminal --maximize

--> remove sound in wrong emacs command:
console only removal:
rmmod pcspkr

System wide removal
Blacklisting the pcspkr module will prevent udev from loading it at boot:
sudo echo "blacklist pcspkr" > /etc/modprobe.d/nobeep.conf

sudo nano /etc/inputrc
uncomment the line with bell-style none

--> get the .myvars, .emacs, and git script from my github, MagicPoulp
https://github.com/MagicPoulp/my-env-files-for-emacs-and-git.git

--> set up the pinning of packages from debian testing and unstable
PINNING is dangerous! one can make the distribution unstable or remove vital packages
We only want to update if asked, so we use negative priorities

1.
apt-get clean
apt-get autoclean
nano /etc/apt/apt.conf
APT::Cache-Limit "100000000";

2. add an append.list in the sources.list.d
http://www.binarytides.com/enable-testing-repo-debian/

# jessie-backports, pinned 100 by default so that it does not install by default
deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-free

# Testing repository - main, contrib and non-free branches
deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian testing main non-free contrib
deb-src http://http.us.debian.org/debian testing main non-free contrib


# Testing security updates repository
deb http://security.debian.org/ testing/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ testing/updates main contrib non-free


# Unstable repo main, contrib and non-free branches, no security updates here
deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian unstable main non-free contrib
deb-src http://http.us.debian.org/debian unstable main non-free contrib

3. set up the pinning not taking all from unstable

https://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences

add into:
/etc/apt/preferences.d/preferences
---> NO DOT (.) in the filename in the preferences.d directory


#backports are pinnined at 100 by default

Package: *
Pin: release a=testing
Pin-Priority: -5

Package: *
Pin: release o=Debian
Pin-Priority: -10


----------------------------------------------------

--> first packages to install:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
it will update all the backports packages for the graphics card

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -t testing gcc g++ cmake apt-file

--> to fix the dmesg error:
sudo apt-file search NAME of missing file in dmesg
something like firmware: failed to load rtl_nic/rtl8168g-2.fw

install from apt-get and not from .deb because only apt makes updates
