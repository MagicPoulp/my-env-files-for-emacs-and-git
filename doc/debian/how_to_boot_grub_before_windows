When both debian and windows are in EFI mode, windows will always try to start first.

GRUB is the debian linux boot loader.

Here is a solution. Be carefult because it will forever short circuit the default windows fwbootmgr.
But if you can boot on Windows from GRUB, it should be fine to have only grub.

1. In the BIOS (during the start), remove all the secure boot things related to Windows (there are many)
And this before installing debian
2. Install debian
3. make sure windows can be started from grub
use F12 (or F8 and the BIOS) to boot on GRUB
start windows from GRUB
4. in windows, WIndows system, start a command shell awit hright click run as administrator
bcdedit /enum firmware
bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\DEBIAN\GRUBX64.EFI
It will link to GRUB when Windows tries to start. But no worry since GRUB can also start windows.
And bootmgr is not vital.
5. retart the computer
